/*
Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number sorted in non-decreasing order.



Example 1:

Input: nums = [-4,-1,0,3,10]
Output: [0,1,9,16,100]
Explanation: After squaring, the array becomes [16,1,0,9,100].
After sorting, it becomes [0,1,9,16,100].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [-7,-3,2,3,11]
Output: [4,9,9,49,121]


Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 104
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.


Follow up: Squaring each element and sorting the new array is very trivial, could you find an O(n) solution using a different approach?

var sortedSquares = function (nums) {
  let arr = [];
  for (let n of nums) {
    arr.push(Math.pow(n, 2));
  }
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    for (let j = i + 1; j < arr.length; j++) {
      if (arr[i] > arr[j]) {
        let temp = arr[i];
        arr[i] = arr[j];
        arr[j] = temp;
      }
    }
  }
  return arr;
};
